## Project Description

### Overview

In this project, I created a menu-based program for RHCSA Version 8 using Python. This program allows users to run Linux and Docker commands by simply selecting keywords from a menu. The project covers the following concepts:

- **How to add a user**: Managing user accounts on a Linux system.
- **How to configure web services**: Setting up and managing web servers.
- **How to configure remote execution program**: Configuring remote access and execution of commands.
- **How to configure Docker**: Setting up Docker containers and managing them.
- **How to Launch a Ubuntu container**: Running an Ubuntu container using Docker.
- **Basics commands of Linux**: Executing essential Linux commands such as date, cal, pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, lvcreate, vgcreate, cron, fstab, and more.

### Objective

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for common system administration tasks and Docker container management.

## Features

- **Basic Commands**: Execute basic system commands.
- **Manage Services**: Manage system services.
- **Run Commands**: Run custom commands.
- **Crontab**: Schedule tasks with cron.
- **Docker**: Docker-related operations.
- **Webserver**: Manage a web server.
- **Fdisk Utility**: Work with disk partitions.
- **LVM**: Logical Volume Management.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Any additional dependencies mentioned in the program.

### Future Scope
## Potential Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and access control for different menu options.

- **Logging:** Add logging functionality to track user actions and system responses.

- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling to provide informative messages to users.

- **Testing:** Develop unit tests and integration tests to ensure program reliability.

- **Enhanced Menu Options:** Expand the menu options to include more advanced system management tasks.

- **GUI Interface:** Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.

We welcome contributions and ideas to enhance the functionality and usability of this program. If you have any suggestions for future enhancements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
